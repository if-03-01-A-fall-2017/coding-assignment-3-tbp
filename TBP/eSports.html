      <p>Labeling video games as sports is a controversial point of debate.</br> While some point to the growth in popularity of eSports as justification for designating some games as sports, others contend that video games will never reach the status of "true sports".</br> However popularity is not the only reason identified: some have argued that "careful planning, precise timing, and skillful execution" ought to be what classifies an activity as sport, and that physical exertion and outdoor playing areas are not required by all traditional or non-traditional 'sports'.</br> In a 2014 technology conference, when asked about the recent buyout of popular game streaming service Twitch, ESPN president John Skipper described eSports as "not a sport – they're a competition".</br> In 2013 on an episode of Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel the panelist openly laughed at the topic.</br> In addition, many in the fighting games community maintain a distinction between their competitive gaming competitions and the more commercially connected eSports competitions of other genres.</br> Video games are sometimes classified as a mind sport.</br> In the 2015 eSports World Championship hosted by the International e-Sports Federation, an eSports panel was hosted with guests from international sports society to discuss the future recognition of eSports as a recognized, legitimate sporting activity worldwide.</p>
